A participant will notify HA about:

DTM interaction with HA:
		- As a part of our failure model we can distinguish between states of
		the process which can be in the following states:
			- RECOVERING
			- ONLINE
			- TRANSIENT
            - PERMANENT_FAILURE
		- State Diagram:

		- Motr code does not define states of Motr processes.
		- Notation and notification of the process state is defined by HA.

		- During startup Motr receives entry point information from HA.
		- When HA restarts a process it sends a message to the participant.

Questions:
Q1: Do we have any hard expectations in terms of time about how long the cluster can
  take to get to ONLINE state?
A1: We dont.
Q2: Does HA wait for all participants to be ONLINE before intimating the originator?
A2: During initial startup HA will wait for all participants to be ONLINE.
    During other cases it can allow progress with the minimum number of participants.

Workflow:

W1: During cluster startup after a clean shutdown.
- HA sends a start message to all participants of cluster.
  [list of participants, endpoint information of configuration manager, etc ..]

- Participant will notify HA that it is READY.
  [participant sends clock information to HA(Transaction_Id perhaps??)] => Need a seperate document/discussion.
  ## Clock information represents the last STABLE state information on the
     participant.
- HA starts originators and shares participants are ONLINE.
  [list of participants, endpoint information of configuration manager, etc ..]

  During cluster shutdown,
  - HA will tell originator to stop sending requests.
    [arguments unknown ??]
  - HA will wait for a confirmation from originator that all requests that
    were issued are reported to be persistent by all the participants??
    [status, more return values ??]
  - HA sends a shutdown message to all the participants and originator.
    [arguments unknown ??]

W2: During cluster startup after an unclean shutdown.
- HA sends a start message to all participants of cluster.
  [list of participants, endpoint information of configuration manager, etc ..]
- Participant will notify HA that it is READY.
  [participant sends clock information to HA]
- HA directs participants to perform RECOVERY.
  ## How do participants determine which records need to be
     sent to recovering participants for REDO? (Resolved)
- Participants notify HA after they have RECOVERED the persistent state.
  [no arguments??]
- HA starts originators and shares participants are ONLINE.

W3: Monitoring workflows.
- HA queries the completion or in-progress state of requests on originator/participants.
  Or alternatively, originator/participant proactively notifies HA the progress of
  requests completion.
  [arguments??]


--------

1) HA needs to monitor the state of all participants
2) HA delivers this information to all participants or to specific participant.

- One message from participant to HA when it is ready to receive metadata messages
- HA needs to send a message to a node that is should begin recovery.
- Node should send recovery done message. (This can be a trigger )
